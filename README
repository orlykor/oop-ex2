Aggressive.java - The aggressive spaceship. This ship pursues other ships and tries to fire at them.
Basher.java - The Basher spaceship. This ship will always accelerate, and will constantly turn towards the 
closest ship.
Drunkard.java - The Drunkard spaceship. This spaceship doesn't have a certain method so it does random moves.
HumanControlled.java -The Human spaceship. This spaceship is controlled by the user. 
Runner.java - The Runner spaceship. This spaceship attempts to run away from the fight.
Special.java - The Special spaceship. This spaceship does special acts that differs from the other ships.
SpaceShip.java- the super class. its a base class for the other spaceship.
SpaceShipFactory.java - Creates all the spaceship objects according to the command line arguments.

=============================

I designed the supper class to be a base class which all the other sub classes(the different ships) can
inherit from this class- is a relation(all the sub ships are a spaceship). I choose do use that implemention 
because I had classes in the sup class that all the other ships used them. 
I didnt use abstract class for example, because I didnt have any methods i didnt want to implement in the sup 
class, and also, the human class i did, had differents methods the other classes didnt have. for example, at 
the begging I wanted to make an abstract method of the acceleration method, but then I realized that the 
human class doesnt use it (has I wanted to). for that I used the base class implemention, I didn't want to 
"sign a contract" between the sup class and the sub classes(that is also the reason why I didnt use 
interface).


the pros of that I used the inherittion method in my sup class, are that all the other sub classes of mine 
can inherit but also, are not obligated to use all the methods it supplies.
cons- its very dangerous, because a single change in the super class casues changes in the sub classed, and 
maybe sometimes those changes are not good for the sub classes implemention.


also, I wrote all the methods in the sup class, because all the other sub classes need to do the excat thing.
 if we look at it as the real world, so for example there is the mother ship that gives birth to little some 
spaceships so they have the same options as the mothership has, but, like family, every child is differ a bit 
from the others, but they all have the same family name, mother and cetera. I looked at this program the same
way, every ship is the same as the other, with a little change in each.
 if i consider the code repetition, I can surely say its a pro for the way I chose.
(as meanwhile with interface in this case it doesn't). - for example in the doAction method I needed to add
1 energy to each spaceship so, I did it in the super class, and override it in the other class. so it goes 
 for the different methods I did.

=============================

I chose to do every spaceship in a different class because every one of them add different behavior. but them
all had the basic methods they inherited from the super class.

The drunkard ship - This ship does random moves. I generated random numbers between -1 to 1, so Sometimes it
will turn right and sometimes left or none.
Moreover, the pilot drank so much, he doesn't notice when he pushes the teleport button.
But when the pilot see a ship near him, he gets sober and try to shot at her direction and turn on 
his shield. I implement it so it will go as random as it can, but meanwhile it can operate and try to
fight.

specialShip- first, I changed the ship image for the image of the pokemon "pikachu" so it will be more fun to
play the game. I also changed its shield to be the "pocadur" image.
the special ship basically floating around at space, but when a ship gets close to it, it feels threatened 
and try to escape and fire back. that makes the ship angry and so it wants to revenge and tries to attack the 
other ships around it. also, once in a while it likes to play and transport to another quiet place.
